# Eiffel-Toolbox

## DESCRIPTION

A collection of practical, reusable tools/utilities or blocks of functionality, which could suit a variety of eiffel projects that covers both basic and advanced topics

## Dependencies

The Eiffel-Toolbox source code is only dependant on the EIFFEL-GAME2 library for eiffel as it is used for the rendering portions of the demo programs. It is easy to make the Eiffel-Toolbox systems back into a standalone state provided the user/programmer is accustomed to the eiffel programming language, however its integration with EIFFEL-GAME2 is provided out of box for convenience and demo purposes.

* To download the EIFFEL-GAME2 64bit dll libraries needed: [Eiffel Game2 Download](https://www.eiffelgame2.org/index.php/download/) or view the EG2 Github repo [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/tioui/Eiffel_Game2#installation-on-windows)

## How to use

Each cluster/sub-directory of Eiffel-Toolbox contains a tool or pieces of code that could be used inside any other eiffel projects, simply adapt it to your need and remove any dependencies if unwanted. Each code cluster contains its own markdown file (these .md files are not yet implemented*) explaining the piece of code and how to use it, as well as the source code containing explanations about its various systems and potential uses.
